# Ansible Module Development

## Overview

This is a distilled version of the Ansible Dev Docs for Ansible Module development.
I felt that the docs were a bit difficult to ingest and also to find.

This is mostly a quick read of the Getting Started and doing local development 
pages.

## My Versions
